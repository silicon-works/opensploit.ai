# Keybinds

OpenSploit uses a leader key system to avoid conflicts with terminal shortcuts. The default leader is `ctrl+x`.

---

## Leader Key

Most keybinds require pressing the leader key first, then the action key. For example:

- `ctrl+x` then `n` → New session
- `ctrl+x` then `l` → List sessions

Configure the leader key in `opensploit.json`:

```json
{
  "keybinds": {
    "leader": "ctrl+x"
  }
}
```

## Customization

Override keybinds in `opensploit.json`:

```json
{
  "keybinds": {
    "leader": "ctrl+x",
    "session.new": "<leader>n",
    "session.list": "<leader>l",
    "session.compact": "<leader>c",
    "app.quit": "<leader>q",
    "sidebar.toggle": "<leader>b",
    "theme.select": "<leader>t",
    "model.list": "<leader>m",
    "agent.list": "<leader>a",
    "message.undo": "<leader>u",
    "message.redo": "<leader>r",
    "message.copy": "<leader>y"
  }
}
```

---

## Disabling Keybinds

Set any keybind to `"none"` to disable it:

```json
{
  "keybinds": {
    "session.share": "none",
    "session.fork": "none"
  }
}
```

## Platform Notes

### macOS

Option key (`⌥`) is used for `alt` keybinds. Some terminals require configuration to send proper escape sequences.

### Windows Terminal

Add to `settings.json` to enable `Shift+Enter`:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "command": {
        "action": "sendInput",
        "input": "\u001b[13;2u"
      },
      "keys": "shift+enter"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Linux

Most terminals work out of the box. For clipboard support, install `xclip` (X11) or `wl-clipboard` (Wayland).
