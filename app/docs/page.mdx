# Getting Started

OpenSploit is an open source AI-powered penetration testing agent. It orchestrates security tools through intelligent automation, guiding you through reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and reporting phases.

<Warning>
OpenSploit is for **authorized security testing only**. You must have explicit written permission before testing any system. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.
</Warning>

---

## Prerequisites

To use OpenSploit, you'll need:

1. **Docker** - Required for running security tools in containers
2. **A modern terminal emulator** like [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
3. **API keys** for the LLM provider you want to use (or use Ollama for local models)

---

## Install

The easiest way to install OpenSploit is through the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opensploit.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install using package managers:

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install -g opensploit
```

**Using Bun:**
```bash
bun install -g opensploit
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew install opensploit
```

<Tip>
Run `opensploit doctor` after installation to verify all dependencies are correctly installed.
</Tip>

---

## Configure

OpenSploit supports 75+ LLM providers. You can use cloud providers like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, or run locally with Ollama.

1. Run the `/connect` command to configure your provider:

```bash
/connect
```

2. Select your provider and enter your API key.

3. For local models with Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Then select Ollama as your provider in OpenSploit.

## Quick Start

Navigate to a directory where you want to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace
```

Start OpenSploit:

```bash
opensploit
```

Describe your target and objective in natural language:

```
Perform a security assessment on 10.10.10.1
```

OpenSploit will:
1. Clarify the scope and target with you
2. Begin reconnaissance (port scanning, service detection)
3. Move through enumeration, exploitation, and reporting phases
4. Request approval before each significant action

---

## Practical Workflows

### Reconnaissance

Ask OpenSploit to scan a target:

```
Scan 192.168.1.0/24 for open ports and services
```

The agent will use nmap to discover hosts and services, presenting findings as it goes.

### Web Application Testing

Reference a target URL for web testing:

```
Test https://target.local for common web vulnerabilities
```

OpenSploit will enumerate directories, fingerprint technologies, and test for issues like SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypasses.

### Credential Testing

Test discovered credentials:

```
Try these credentials against the SSH service on 10.10.10.5
```

The agent will use tools like Hydra for credential testing, always requesting confirmation first.

### Reporting

Generate a report at any point:

```
Generate a report of findings so far
```

OpenSploit compiles all discoveries, successful exploits, and recommendations into a structured report.

---

## File References

Reference files in your prompts using the `@` symbol:

```
Analyze the scan results in @nmap_results.xml
```

OpenSploit will include the file contents in context and reason about them.

---

## Shell Commands

Execute shell commands directly by prefixing with `!`:

```
!docker ps
```

The output is included in the conversation, allowing follow-up questions.

## Key Concepts

### Phases

OpenSploit follows a structured penetration testing methodology:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting |
| **Enumeration** | Directory bruteforcing, vulnerability scanning, version detection |
| **Exploitation** | SQL injection testing, credential attacks, exploit execution |
| **Post-Exploitation** | Privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement |
| **Reporting** | Findings aggregation, report generation |

### Tools

OpenSploit orchestrates 25+ security tools including nmap, sqlmap, ffuf, hydra, nuclei, and metasploit. Tools run in Docker containers and are downloaded on-demand.

### Agents

OpenSploit uses a hierarchical agent system. The master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents for specific tasks, preventing context overload during long engagements.

## Safety

OpenSploit is for **authorized security testing only**. The system includes safeguards:

- Warns before scanning external/non-private IP addresses
- Requires explicit confirmation for external targets
- Blocks scanning of forbidden targets (government, military, critical infrastructure)
- Logs all scan authorizations for audit purposes
