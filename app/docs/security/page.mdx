# Security & Legal

OpenSploit is designed for **authorized security testing only**. This page covers the safety features and legal considerations.

---

## Authorization Requirements

> **You must have explicit written permission before testing any system.**

Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal under laws including:
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** - United States
- **Computer Misuse Act** - United Kingdom
- **Similar legislation** in most countries worldwide

Violations can result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, and imprisonment.

## Built-in Safeguards

### Target Validation

OpenSploit warns before scanning non-private IP addresses:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️  EXTERNAL TARGET WARNING                                │
│                                                             │
│  You are about to scan: example.com                         │
│  This is NOT a localhost or private IP address.             │
│                                                             │
│  Before proceeding, confirm:                                │
│  ☐ I have written authorization to test this target         │
│  ☐ I understand unauthorized testing is illegal             │
│  ☐ I accept full responsibility for this action             │
│                                                             │
│  [Cancel]                              [Proceed with Scan]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Forbidden Targets

OpenSploit blocks scanning of certain targets:
- Government domains (.gov, .mil)
- Critical infrastructure
- Known protected networks

### Audit Logging

All actions are logged for accountability:

```
Location: ~/.opensploit/audit.log
Format: JSON Lines (machine-parseable)
Contents: timestamp, session, action, target, result
```

---

## Approval Flow

OpenSploit requests explicit approval before:

- Scanning external/non-private IP addresses
- Running privileged containers
- Executing exploits
- Modifying files on target systems
- Downloading sensitive data

---

## Safe Testing Targets

For learning and practice, use authorized targets:

### Local Labs
- **Docker vulnerable apps** - DVWA, bWAPP, Mutillidae
- **VMs** - Metasploitable, VulnHub machines
- **Your own systems** - Local development environments

### Online Labs (Authorized)
- **HackTheBox** - hackthebox.com
- **TryHackMe** - tryhackme.com
- **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** - portswigger.net
- **PentesterLab** - pentesterlab.com

### Bug Bounty Programs
Many companies run authorized bug bounty programs with defined scope.

---

## Data Handling

### Local-First Architecture

OpenSploit runs entirely on your machine:
- No data sent to external servers (except LLM API calls)
- Session data stored locally
- Findings stored locally
- No telemetry

### Credential Security

- API keys stored in system keychain where available
- Discovered credentials marked as sensitive
- Session data readable only by owner (600 permissions)

### Container Isolation

Security tools run in isolated Docker containers:
- No access to Docker socket
- Minimal capabilities
- Read-only filesystem where possible

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities using OpenSploit:

1. **Do not exploit** beyond proof of concept
2. **Document findings** with reproduction steps
3. **Report privately** to the organization
4. **Allow reasonable time** for remediation
5. **Follow coordinated disclosure** practices
