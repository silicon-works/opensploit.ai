# Share

OpenSploit allows you to share sessions with team members for collaboration on security engagements.

---

## Overview

Sharing creates a public URL for your conversation, enabling:

- Team collaboration on findings
- Knowledge sharing across engagements
- Review of methodology and approach
- Training and documentation

---

## Sharing Modes

Configure sharing behavior in `opensploit.json`:

```json
{
  "share": "manual"
}
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `"manual"` | Share only when you run `/share` (default) |
| `"auto"` | Every session is automatically shared |
| `"disabled"` | Sharing is completely disabled |

---

## Creating a Share

Run the `/share` command:

```
/share
```

A unique URL is generated and copied to your clipboard:

```
https://opensploit.ai/s/abc123xyz
```

Share this URL with team members to give them read access.

---

## Removing a Share

Stop sharing a session with `/unshare`:

```
/unshare
```

The public URL becomes invalid immediately.

---

## Privacy Considerations

> **Warning:** Shared sessions are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL.

Before sharing, review your session for:

- **Target information** - IP addresses, hostnames, URLs
- **Credentials** - Discovered passwords, API keys, tokens
- **Proprietary data** - Client-specific information
- **Exploitation details** - Sensitive vulnerability information

### Best Practices

1. **Redact sensitive data** before sharing
2. **Use for authorized purposes only**
3. **Unshare when collaboration is complete**
4. **Disable sharing for sensitive engagements**

---

## Disabling for Projects

Disable sharing for sensitive projects:

```json
{
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

Or set globally in `~/.config/opensploit/config.json`.

---

## Team Usage

For team engagements:

1. One member shares the session
2. Others can view the shared URL
3. Discussion happens outside OpenSploit
4. Findings are consolidated manually

> Note: Shared sessions are read-only. Team members cannot modify or continue the session.

---

## Self-Hosted Sharing

For organizations requiring data sovereignty, sharing can be self-hosted. Contact us for enterprise deployment options.

---

## Audit Trail

All share actions are logged:

```
Location: ~/.opensploit/audit.log
Events: share_created, share_accessed, share_removed
```

Review the audit log to track who shared what and when.
