# Terminal User Interface

OpenSploit provides an interactive terminal interface for conducting security assessments. Launch it with `opensploit` or target a specific directory using `opensploit /path/to/workspace`.

---

## Overview

The TUI is the primary interface for interacting with OpenSploit. It provides:

- **Conversation view** - Chat with the AI agent about your targets
- **Tool execution display** - Watch security tools run in real-time
- **Session management** - Save and resume engagements
- **File browser** - Reference and analyze files

---

## Launching

Start OpenSploit in the current directory:

```bash
opensploit
```

Start in a specific workspace:

```bash
opensploit /path/to/pentest/engagement
```

Resume a previous session:

```bash
opensploit --session <session-id>
```

---

## File References

Reference files in your prompts using the `@` symbol:

```
Analyze the vulnerabilities in @nmap_scan.xml
```

The `@` symbol triggers fuzzy file search, allowing you to quickly find and include file contents in your conversation.

---

## Shell Integration

Execute shell commands by prefixing with `!`:

```
!nmap -sV 10.10.10.1
```

The command output becomes part of the conversation, enabling follow-up analysis.

---

## Slash Commands

The TUI supports slash commands for common actions:

| Command | Function | Keybind |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `/connect` | Configure provider API keys | — |
| `/compact` | Summarize the session | `ctrl+x c` |

## Tool Execution Display

When OpenSploit runs security tools, the TUI shows:

- **Tool name** - Which tool is executing (nmap, sqlmap, etc.)
- **Parameters** - Arguments passed to the tool
- **Progress** - Real-time output from the tool
- **Results** - Parsed findings and recommendations

Toggle detailed output with `/details` or `ctrl+x d`.

---

## Configuration

Configure TUI behavior in `opensploit.json`:

```json
{
  "tui": {
    "scroll_speed": 3,
    "scroll_acceleration": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `scroll_speed` | Lines to scroll per input | `3` |
| `scroll_acceleration.enabled` | Enable smooth scrolling | `true` |

---

## Editor Setup

The `/editor` and `/export` commands use the `EDITOR` environment variable:

```bash
# VS Code
export EDITOR="code --wait"

# Vim
export EDITOR="vim"

# Nano
export EDITOR="nano"
```

On Windows, set this via System Properties or your PowerShell profile.
